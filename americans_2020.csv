The Definitive Ranking Of The Wealthiest Americans In 2020,EDITED BY KERRY A. DOLAN,WITH CHASE PETERSON-WITHORN,AND JENNIFER WANG,PRESENTED BY NUVEEN,Pandemic be damned: America’s 400 richest are worth a record $3.2 trillion, up $240 billion from a year ago, aided by a stock market that has defied the virus. Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, worth $179 billion, is number one for the third year in a row, followed by Bill Gates at number two. It still takes at least $2.1 billion, unchanged for the past three years, to make the cut. Even in these trying times mega-fortunes are still being minted. We welcome 18 new members to the ranks, who made their piles in everything from electric trucks to the now-ubiquitous Zoom. Plus there are 9 returnees -- former 400 members who fell off the list and have made a comeback. Two from last year’s list died, and 25 dropped off as their fortunes fell; 10 of those setbacks were directly attributable to the Covid crisis. Forbes calculated net worths using stock prices from July 24, 2020. For the full methodology of the 39th annual ranking of America’s richest people, see here.,quote pulled left
